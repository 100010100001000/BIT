# Binary Interpolation Tree (B.I.T)

Binary Interpolation Tree is a machine learning model i have been working on mostly out of curiosity. Please let me know if my terminology is off, i made any other errors, or something very similar already exists. 

The main idea was to conceptionalize a model that provides:

fast runtime on cpu's in relation to model complexity (O(n), Î©(1), input dependent)
the ability to further simplify computations based on a maximum inaccuracy
simple and fast training
very low initial model complexity that increases during training
multithreading capabilities for maximum cpu usage
increased transparency compared to other ML models
a parameter regarding determinism of the algorithm
